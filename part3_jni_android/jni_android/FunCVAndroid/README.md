Android OpenCV (C++) example
==================

1. Download OpenCV Android from the official site, something like `opencv-4.7.0-android-sdk.zip`.
Save it somehere on your computer.

2. Unzip the zip file, you'll get the directory `OpenCV-android-sdk`.

3. Important! In this project there is a file `app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt`.
Find the hardcoded OpenCV path there and change to your actual path `<somewhere>/OpenCV-android-sdk/sdk/native`.

4. Build and Enjoy !
